The break down
The first step was creating the constants that would be used in all the functions to reduce the amount of typing to be done while
coding the functions. This is done in the code shown below.

This constant stores the skill name to be used by the function to be able to locate what it is looking for.
const SKILL_NAME = 'World Facts';

This constant is just a string that is included in the begining of every function.
const GET_FACT_MESSAGE = "Your fun fact about ";

This was built in to the blueprint however I modified it to compliment my program so when the user says help this string with display.
const HELP_MESSAGE = 'You can say tell me a world fact, or, you can say exit... What can I help you with?';

This was also built in and plays if the user does not reposnd to the first help message prompt.
const HELP_REPROMPT = 'What can I help you with?';

This is a string that plays when the user stops the program.
const STOP_MESSAGE = 'Hope you had fun learning! bye!';


The next constants were 7 arrays all assigned to one continent that stored multiple facts about each continent.

This bit of code starts the program when the intro intent is said then prompts the user to pick a continent and listens to what the user 
says.
'introintent': function () {
        //Asks what continents array to call the fact from
        this.response.speak("what continent do you want to learn about?").listen("what continent do you want to learn about?");
        this.emit(':responseReady');
       
This was a built in function that emits the constant HELP_MESSAGE and will display HELP_REPROMPT if the user doesnt answer in a certain 
amount of time.
 'AMAZON.HelpIntent': function () {
        const speechOutput = HELP_MESSAGE;
        const reprompt = HELP_REPROMPT;

        this.response.speak(speechOutput).listen(reprompt);
        this.emit(':responseReady');
    },
    
    This function is used to exit the code.
    'AMAZON.StopIntent': function () {
        this.response.speak(STOP_MESSAGE);
        this.emit(':responseReady');
    },
    
    There are 7 functions like this for each continent. This function is called when the user says North America. The function will the 
    constant GET_FACT_MESSAGE which is "Your fun fact about " with the string "North America is " and a random string from the 
    NORTHAMERICA array list. After combining them into one string it will print that string aswell as the string "If you want to hear 
    another fact say another or the same continent" then it will listen for the user to say a new continent or stop.
     'northAmericaFacts': function () {
        const factArr = NORTHAMERICA;
        const factIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * factArr.length);
        const randomFact = factArr[factIndex];
        const speechOutput = GET_FACT_MESSAGE + 'North America is ' + randomFact;
        
         this.response.cardRenderer(SKILL_NAME, randomFact);
        //Outputs speech and listens for another continent to be said.
        this.response.speak(speechOutput + ' If you want to hear another fact say another or the same continent').listen("what continent 
        do you want to learn about?");
        this.emit(':responseReady');

    },

One challenge I had while creating this program was being able to have the code not just exit after emitting one fact and prompt the 
user to enter another continent to learn about. I feel this was an important addition because if the user wanted to use the program more 
than once they would have to open it over and over now you can use it until your done and just say stop.


This Program can have very useful implementions for example if it was connected to a online news database and that was updated it could 
give global news about a region you want to hear about. Or it can be manipulated in one example if a user had multiple tests to study 
for they could make the array lists each one subject then enter string they need to study and choose what topic to learn about by simply 
talking to their alexa.
